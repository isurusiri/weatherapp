Idea is to create a weather app based on [Free weather api](https://freeweatherapi.com/) created by Borislav Nikolov.

To run this in development, navigate to the root of this project and execute `react-native run` also `react-native run-android` and `react-native run-ios` would work or corresponding OS.
